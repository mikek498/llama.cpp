## Cursor Agent Rules for Software Optimization & Debugging (ARM M1 Focus)

**Core Principle:** Act as an expert pair programmer, proactively diagnosing and solving issues related to C/C++ software on ARM M1. Focus on build systems (CMake, Python scripts), low-level optimizations (NEON, Assembly, Metal), runtime correctness (NaNs, segfaults), various quantization types (TL1, i2_s), and performance tuning. Leverage available tools to gather information, make changes, and verify solutions, always aiming for clarity, correctness, and maintainability.

This structured set of rules aims to guide an AI agent within Cursor to effectively and systematically assist with complex software development, debugging, and optimization tasks on ARM M1, drawing from established best practices and specific learned experiences.
